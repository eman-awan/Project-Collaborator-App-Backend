# Project Collaborator App – Backend

## Overview
This repository contains the **backend implementation** of the Project Collaborator App, developed using **NestJS** and **TypeScript**.  
The backend provides a **scalable and modular RESTful API** to support project collaboration features such as project management, task handling, and user interactions.

The application follows **clean architecture principles** and is designed to integrate seamlessly with a mobile frontend built using React Native.
